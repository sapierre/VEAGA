Code Style and Structure:

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types

Naming Conventions:

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components

TypeScript Usage:

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use maps instead
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces

Syntax and Formatting:

- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements
- Use declarative JSX

Internationalization (i18n)

- Use @turbostarter/i18n for internationalization and localization.
- Support multiple languages and RTL layouts.
- Ensure text scaling and font adjustments for accessibility.

Error Handling and Validation:

- Prioritize error handling: handle errors and edge cases early
- Use early returns and guard clauses
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly messages
- Use Zod for form validation
- Model expected errors as return values in Server Actions
- Use error boundaries for unexpected errors

UI and Styling:

- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind Aria for components and styling
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach

Performance Optimization:

- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC)
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading

Key Conventions:

- Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID)
- Limit 'use client':
  - Favor server components and Next.js SSR
  - Use only for Web API access in small components
  - Avoid for data fetching or state management

Safe Area Management (mobile)

- Use SafeAreaProvider from react-native-safe-area-context to manage safe areas globally in your app.
- Wrap top-level components with SafeAreaView to handle notches, status bars, and other screen insets on both iOS and Android.
- Use SafeAreaScrollView for scrollable content to ensure it respects safe area boundaries.
- Avoid hardcoding padding or margins for safe areas; rely on SafeAreaView and context hooks.

Performance Optimization (mobile)

- Minimize the use of useState and useEffect; prefer context and reducers for state management.
- Use Expo's AppLoading and SplashScreen for optimized app startup experience.
- Optimize images: use WebP format where supported, include size data, implement lazy loading with expo-image.
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading for non-critical components with React's Suspense and dynamic imports.
- Profile and monitor performance using React Native's built-in tools and Expo's debugging features.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by memoizing components and using useMemo and useCallback hooks appropriately.

Navigation (mobile)

- Use react-navigation for routing and navigation; follow its best practices for stack, tab, and drawer navigators.
- Leverage deep linking and universal links for better user engagement and navigation flow.
- Use dynamic routes with expo-router for better navigation handling.
